# python-OpenAI

## Objectives of this repository
Detail and share how to use python scripts to connect to the OpenAI API, run prompts through API calls and use the AI content results generated within additional scripts.

## Context
This can be useful when we need to generate content at scale, for example in the case of demo data for a pre sales demo environment in which we want the data to look real (different than lastname1, test1, comment1 ...).\
No matter where and how we will store the data, the first step is to generate it and this where with the use of the right function in our python script in combination with the right prompt, we will get the best results.\
More details below.

## Installation
The first step is to install the OpenAI Python library
> [!TIP]
> The following article, straight from the OpenAI documentation, [Get up and running with the OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=python), is obviously very helpful.

We use the following code to install the library:
```
pip install --upgrade openai
```
> [!NOTE]
> We may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.
> Once this completes, running `pip list` will show you the Python libraries you have installed in your current environment, which should confirm that the OpenAI Python library was successfully installed.

As for authentication, the OpenAI API uses API keys. We can visit our [API Keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to retrieve the API key we'll use in our requests.
